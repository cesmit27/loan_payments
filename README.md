**Loan Payment Calculator**

Calculates time to pay off loan, total amount to pay off loan, and how much of that is interest. Requires input of loan amount, annual interest rate, and monthly payment.

I put default values in as my actual loans that I owe for my college loans because I'm too lazy to look up and type in my loans.
